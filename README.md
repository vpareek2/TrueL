Veer Pareek Fake News Project

There is a massive influx of fake news in todays day and age, especially with social media. This algorithm will allow one to authenticate a news article at a rate of 93.29% accuracy. Also, the list of news articles used in the project is under release v1.0.0 on the right side of the screen (for most users). The file was too large for it to be in the repository. The program was created in Python using Jupyter Notebook.
